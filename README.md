# Factoryfx

*Dependency Injection Framework.*

## Introduction

Factoryfx is a lightweight Dependency Injection Framework.:

when you manually use dependency injection you have 2 types of objects.
**business logic
**Factory code which instantiate the business logic objects
explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfLCWKxHJ0&index=3&list=PL693EFD059797C21E#t=30m

Most dependency Injection Frameworks automate the Factory code.
Factoryfx takes a different approach by defining a manually created structure for the factories.


**no reflection magic means easy to debug and no supprises at runtime
**you can add configuration data to the factories
**validates at compile-time
